I can't seem to compile the pdf anymore??

The latex compiles, but the buttons are off the page now, even w/o changes to
the latex sources. The ``interactive image" is unusable. Something upstream
changed? There's no point trying to fix it now-- the pdf is as is.

(I first noticed this a while back, but I thought I'd formally make a note of
 it now.)
